        <p data-aos="flip-right" data-aos-duration="1500" data-aos-delay="1100">As a Full-Stack Developer, I specialize in both front-end and back-end development, bringing a comprehensive approach to building modern, dynamic web applications. On the front-end, I work with tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces that look great on any device. I am passionate about crafting seamless, engaging experiences that are intuitive and accessible. <br><br>

            On the back-end, I work with Geany scalable systems that power applications behind the scenes. I’m also familiar with SQL databases ensuring smooth data handling and communication between the client and server. Whether it's designing databases, integrating third-party services, or optimizing performance, I focus on creating efficient, maintainable, and secure back-end solutions. <br><br>
            
            I am always learning and experimenting with the latest technologies, frameworks, and tools to enhance my skills and stay ahead in the ever-evolving field of web development. My goal is to build full-fledged applications that not only meet functional requirements but also deliver exceptional user experiences. Let’s collaborate and bring your ideas to life with cutting-edge web technologies!</p>
